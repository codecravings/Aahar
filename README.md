# 🥘 Aahar

**Your desi gym bro calorie tracker that roasts you for eating junk.**
Because MyFitnessPal doesn't judge you in Hinglish. And frankly… it should.

Aahar isn't just a calorie tracker.
It's a digital gym bro living in your pocket, watching every bite 👀

> "Protein kam hai bhai."
> "Yeh snack nahi, emotional decision tha."

## 🔥 What is Aahar?

Aahar (आहार) means nourishment.

This app helps you track food like a disciplined monk…
while bullying you like a gym friend who skips leg day with you.

AI scans your food.
Tracks macros.
Builds streaks.
Roasts your poor decisions.

All offline-first. All private. All yours.

## ✨ Features

### 📸 AI Food Scanner

Snap a photo → AI estimates calories, protein, carbs, fat.

Yes it recognizes:

* samosa
* biryani
* dal chawal
* your Thali
* your "light snack" that is absolutely not light

And it responds emotionally.

---

### 📝 Description Mode

Add context before analysis:

> "home cooked poha with peanuts"

Because AI sometimes thinks poha is scrambled eggs and starts a war.

---

### ✍️ Manual Entry

For when:

* lighting is bad
* AI is confused
* you're ashamed
* it's 3am Maggi

No judgement. Only numbers.

(Okay, some judgement.)

---

### 💾 Save to Quick Add

Save frequently eaten foods for instant logging later.

Your daily protein shake, boiled eggs, or "emergency dal chawal" — one tap away.

Custom foods appear first in Quick Add. Because you earned that convenience.

---

### 🔄 Edit & Delete

Swipe to fix logs.

Mistakes happen.
Macros don't forgive, but Aahar does.

---

### 📊 Macro Tracking

Tracks:

* Calories
* Protein
* Carbs
* Fat

Optional micros:

* Fiber
* Sugar
* Sodium
* Iron
* Calcium
* Vitamin D

Because gains are built on data, not vibes.

---

### 😄 Emoji Meal Tags

Tag meals with emotional intent:

🍗 Beast mode
🍕 Weak moment
🥗 Redemption arc
🍜 Late-night regret

Nutrition meets storytelling.

---

### 🔁 Streaks & XP

Gamification system:

* Daily logging streaks
* XP leveling
* Discipline score
* Achievement badges

Because consistency > motivation.

Miss a day and the app will notice.

---

### 🤖 Multiple AI Models

Choose your fighter:

**Google Gemini:**
* Flash → fast & cheap
* Flash Lite → fastest, slightly dumb
* Pro → slow but scary accurate

**OpenAI:**
* GPT-5 Mini → reasoning model, thinks before responding.

Switch anytime in settings.

Your patience vs accuracy slider.

---

## 🧠 App Personality

Aahar talks like your gym bro + monk hybrid:

> "Aaj macros pavitra the."
> "Calories zyada ho gaye. Cardio karega ya ignore karega?"
> "Protein adhura hai. Sharir intezaar kar raha hai."

This is intentional.

Tracking food should not feel like Excel.

---

```bash
flutter pub get
